# dynamodb-migrator

### Summary

I've always disliked coming up with a project and working really hard on getting my DynamoDB database setup with all the correct LSIs and GSIs and all the data placed in the correct spots, only to realize that I need another LSI! This project should help eliminate that shortcoming and help people more easily migrate their databases!
